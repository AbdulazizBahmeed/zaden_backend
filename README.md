# Project README

## Project Title: Zaden Backend


### Description:

This web-based application utilizes artificial intelligence for the purpose of forecasting sales time series data. It has been structured for optimal scalability and is currently operational on [ZADEN.TECH](https://zaden.tech/). in a live environment. Please be aware that due to the intricate nature of this project and its reliance on external services, attempting to run it in a local environment without the appropriate configuration and access to the live deployment is not practical. The reason being that these services require secure HTTPS connections, which are not achievable in a local environment.

### Deployment:
The project is live and accessible at [ZADEN.TECH](https://zaden.tech/). The deployment process involved setting up the entire application on a cloud infrastructure to ensure accessibility and scalability. 

### Features:
- Front-end built using the React framework
- Back-end built with Django in Python
- Integration with Google Cloud services for user authentication and file storage
- Secure HTTPS connection through Nginx
- Scalable architecture with data storage on AWS S3
- User-friendly data visualization using the chart.js library

### Prerequisites:
Since the project is live at [ZADEN.TECH](https://zaden.tech/), you don't need to set up anything locally. You can access the application directly from your web browser.

### Usage:
1. Open your web browser.
2. Navigate to [ZADEN.TECH](https://zaden.tech/).
3. You can now use the features and functionalities of the application without any local setup.
